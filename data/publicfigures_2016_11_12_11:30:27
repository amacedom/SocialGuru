A trio of heavyweight US DJ legends, Frankie Knuckles, Todd Terry and Marshall Jefferson fly in especially for the event.\n\nOver two thousand revellers will come together in the stunning surroundings of the Albert Hall for a distinctive New Year celebration of the highest quality. This event will be the debut of dance music in the specially converted chapel, which has been optimised for music events and has previously hosted a series of specially curated events as part of the Manchester International Festival including unique performances from Goldfrapp, Mogwai and Maxine Peake.\n\nAs befits this unique occasion, the line up for Hacienda New Years Eve party brings together the cream of the original Chicago House producers, Frankie Knuckles and Marshall Jefferson to play from their decades of experience for The Hacienda faithful, joined by New York's very own master of the dance floor Mr. Todd Terry.\n\nFrom his days in the late Seventies at The Warehouse in Chicago, Frankie Knuckles, often referred to as \u2018The Godfather of House\u2019 fused disco music with early electro and then the emerging strains of house music in the mid Eighties, becoming synonymous with records such as \"Your Love\", \"Baby Wants To Ride\", \"Rainfalls\", \"Tears\" and more. Frankie has also remixed numerous high profile and respected artists including Chaka Khan, Diana Ross, Janet and Michael Jackson.\n\nPerforming alongside Frankie is the legendary NY house pioneer Todd Terry. One of the most lauded and respected house DJ\u2019s ever, Todd\u2019s back catalogue sees his own productions such as Orange Lemon\u2019s \u201cDream Of Santa Anna\u201d, Black Riot\u2019s \u201cA Day In The Life\u201d and \u201cJust Make That Move\u201d, CLS\u2019s \u201cCan You Feel It\u201d compete with his extensive repertoire of remixes for space within his innovative and tightly constructed sets. \n\nThe event provides the opportunity to hear three true legends of the scene as Frankie and Todd are joined by Marshall Jefferson, one of the main influences on the development of Chicago House. In crafting classics like \u2018Move Your Body\u2019, Traxx Releases such \u201cOpen Our Eyes\u201d and performing on Ce Ce Roger\u2019s seminal \u201cSomeday\u201d, Marshall has travelled the world preaching the gospel of the original house sound and his name is widely respected for his role in the history of house music. \n\nIn the Albert Hall's main room, Hacienda mainstay Graeme Park joins with the American triumvirate, bringing his sublime mixing and choice of tunes to complement the event along with Herbie Saccani also on the decks. Never ones to miss a major Manchester Hacienda event either, Happy Monday's Rowetta performs a live PA and the city's iconic, one and only Bez is on hand to bring in the New Year in his inimitable fashion. \n\nHacienda Classics is the order of the evening in Albert Hall's second room as Allister Whitehead, Tom Wainwright, 808 State DJ's and Tricky Disko all delve deep into their crates to bring a exceptional collection of the very best tunes which rocked the original Whitworth Street venue, first time around, some well known and some lesser known.\n\nThe Hacienda's New Years Eve parties have become a legendary part of the club's history and with the very best, cutting edge, sound, lighting and design set for of the Albert Hall's grand interior, Hacienda New Years Eve 2013 seems set to both carry on this tradition while creating one all of its very own.\n\nAbout Albert Hall\n\nA Grade II listed Wesleyan chapel in Manchester City Center closed and hidden for over 40 years. Resurrected by Trof, the people behind Gorilla and The Deaf Institute, as an unrivaled events venue, restaurant and bar. The grand and ornate chapel has been restored into a stunning purpose built music hall and is set to become one of the most atmospheric music and events venues in the UK playing host to live music, corporate events, weddings, comedy and theater.",

Cominci\u00f2 a fare il dee jay, nel 1971 al Better Days diNew York, dove lavor\u00f2 con Tee Scott. La sua selezione musicale iniziale prevedeva principalmente funk, jazz, rhythm'n'blues, soul.\nKnuckles si fece subito notare per le sue abilit\u00e0 e perci\u00f2 nel 1972 fu ingaggiato come dj resident del Gallery, locale newyorkese, dove affianc\u00f2 due dj molto popolari: Nicky Siano, che era anche proprietario del locale, e Larry Levan, suo grande amico. I tre furono tra i primi, insieme a Kenny Carpenter, ad introdurre nei club la tecnica del \u201cmixaggio\u201d, ovvero suonare i dischi uno dietro l'altro, senza interruzioni, in modo che la musica scorra con continuit\u00e0. Altra curiosit\u00e0 tecnica, furono tra i primi ad utilizzare pi\u00f9 di due piatti per inserire effetti sonori nel passaggio da un brano all'altro.\nNel 1973 affianc\u00f2 Levan in un altro club storico: Continental Baths. Quando l'anno successivo Levan lasci\u00f2 il locale, Knuckles divenne il dj principale del locale fino alla chiusura. Successivamente affianc\u00f2 Levan in un altro locale storico: il Paradise Garage. Nel 1976, Levan era impegnato infatti nel suo leggendario \"Garage\", quando gli fu proposto di lasciare New York per trasferirsi a Chicago e lavorare al lancio di un altro storico locale: \"Warehouse\". Levan non era intenzionato a lasciare New York e consigli\u00f2 ai proprietari del locale di Chicago di affidare la selezione musicale a Knuckles. Knuckles si trasfer\u00ec a Chicago nel 1977, diventando il dj resident del Warehouse. La presenza di un pubblico diverso da quello newyorkese, lo spinse a sperimentazioni sonore elettroniche e a lavori di re-editing manuale; Knuckles recupera vecchi pezzi funk, jazz e soul e attraverso manipolazioni elettroniche mediante sintetizzatori e registratori, realizz\u00f2 quel genere che poi sarebbe stato denominato House music, il cui nome deriva proprio dal locale in cui Knuckles si esibiva nei suoi dj set. Knuckles contribu\u00ec all'evoluzione della figura del dj: da semplice selezionatore di musica (una sorta di juke box umano) ad artista in grado di creare nuovi ritmi e coinvolgere il pubblico nel ballo. Nel 1983 apr\u00ec un club proprio: il Power Plant.\nQuando alcune difficolt\u00e0 lo costrinsero a chiuderlo, torn\u00f2 a New York, e tra la met\u00e0 degli anni ottanta e i primi novanta divent\u00f2 resident al The World, e successivamente al The Choice, The Sound Factory e The Sound Factory Bar.\nLa sua carriera decoll\u00f2 e inizi\u00f2 a produrre musica. Il suo primo remix risaliva al 1982 per il brano \u201cLet no man put as under\" dei First Choice e a seguire \"I'm going to go\" (1985) di Jago. La sua attivit\u00e0 di produttore inizi\u00f2 invece con \"Your Love\": un classico della musica dance elettronica underground, cantato e prodotto inizialmente da Jamie Principle nel 1984, e caratterizzato da una linea di arpeggi ripetuta e da una potente linea di basso propulsiva. Il disco, contenente un piccolo campione della canzone \"Feels Good\" (1982) degli Electra, venne proposto in un primo momento in una versione demo registrata su nastro magnetico e destinata solo a pochi dj radiofonici. Nel 1987 usc\u00ec negli Stati Uniti il 12\" con le due canzoni cantate da Principle e prodotte da Knuckles: \"Baby Wants To Ride / Your Love\". Il vinile arriv\u00f2 un anno dopo anche in Europa. Questa fu l'edizione definitiva di \"Your Love\", remixata da Knuckles, incisa su licenza di diverse etichette europee, e suonata nei primi rave inglesi.\nKnuckles intanto, nella seconda met\u00e0 degli anni ottanta, si concentr\u00f2 in altre produzioni della Chicago House: assieme al produttore Chip E. incise la sua prima registrazione ufficiale intitolata \"You Can't Hide\", con il cantante Ricky Dillard. Il brano usc\u00ec nel 1987. Nel frattempo pubblic\u00f2 altri successi da club del filone deep house come le canzoni del progetto \"Night Writers\" e il brano \"Tears\" (1989), prodotto con Robert Owens (dei Fingers, Inc.) e Satoshi Tomiee; con i suoi amici newyorkesi David Morales, Satoshi Tomiie e Bobby D'Ambrosio nel 1989 fond\u00f2 inoltre la Def Mix Productions, la cui attivit\u00e0 continua tutt'oggi.\nDopo numerosi singoli e remix nel \u201891 arriv\u00f2 il suo primo album: Beyond The Mix. Il disco conteneva le hit \"The Whistle Song\u201d (probabilmente il brano pi\u00f9 famoso di Frankie Knuckles), \"Rainfalls\" e \"Workout\", che non solo raggiunsero ottimi piazzamenti nelle classifiche dance ma vennero anche particolarmente apprezzati dalla critica. Il giornalista della rivista di billboard Larry Flick nel 1992 afferm\u00f2 infatti che Knuckles fosse probabilmente il miglior artista dance d'America e che nelle sue produzioni \"conosce il groove, conosce la canzone e tutto il quadro\". Nel 1995 pubblic\u00f2 il suo secondo album \"Welcome To The Real World\" con la cantante Adeva, contenente le hit \u201cToo Many Fish\u201d e \"Whadda U Want (From Me)\". Nel 2004 \u00e8 uscito l'album \"A New Reality\".\nSono noti i suoi lavori come remixer su canzoni di Michael Jackson e Diana Ross, per i quali nel 1997 vinse un Grammy.\nIl 25 agosto 2004 \u00e8 stata intitolata a suo nome la strada in cui risiede il Warehouse a Chicago: \"Honorary Frankie Knuckles Way\".\nDal 2011 inizia un sodalizio con la label inglese \"Nocturnal Groove\", riproponendo in chiave moderna alcuni grandi classici del passato, house e non, con lo pseudonimo \"Director's Cut\", progetto al quale prende parte assieme ad Eric Kupper.\n\nLine up:\n\n\u266b Dj Resident: Paolo Pompei feat Janet\n\u266b Regular Guest: Thomas De Lorenzo\n\u266b Special Guest: FRANKE KNUCKLES\n\nINFOLINE\n+30 06 59.16.540\n+39 339 6119070",

Legions of admirers during his travels penned Frankies nickname The Godfather of House the press picked up on it and made it stick.\n\nHe has played a pivotal role in the creation and evolution of house music, which has become the dominant staple of dance clubs throughout the world. It was this celebrity and his constant fundraising for some of his favorite charities dealing with aids, homelessness, and education of our youth, that garnered him one of the most prestigious honors by the City Of Chicago.\n\nOn August 25th 2004, the Mayor of Chicago proclaimed the date Frankie Knuckles day, and a street naming Frankie Knuckles Way .As a Producer and Re-Mixer, Knuckles lent his talents to some of R&B and Pop musics elite. Artists such as Mary J. Blige, Sounds of Blackness, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Diana Ross, Luther Vandross, Michael Bolton and Toni Braxton. Frankies production and mixing career was officially recognized by the music industry in 1997.\n\nHe became the first recipient of a Grammy for Remixer of The Year and has served as a Governor and Trustee, for the NYC Chapter of The National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences.As an artist enjoying the success of two Virgin Records releases, Beyond The Mix and Welcome To The Real World . The first album included The Whistle Song which is most memorable as the Lipton Ice Tea commercial in the mid 90\u2019s.\n\nIn 2001 Definity Records released the single Keep on Movin by Frankie Knuckles featuring vocalist Nicki Richards. The new song opened his Mix album Motivation and was the beginning of the collaboration between Knuckles and Richards 2004 A New Reality release. Billboard Magazine writes in the Album Reviews noteworthy section Knuckles strings together an inspirational and spiritual collection of gospel-infused club songs.\n\nWith critical acclaim from nearly every Electronic Dance and Club Culture magazine through out North America and Europe. Definity strategic crossover plan launched with a visibility campaign in Major Chains for Black History Month in February. Reviews in Vibe, Ebony, Black Beat, Essence, and BET made this Motivation album the first Def Mix Productions release to garner recognition with mainstream Afro American press.\n\nKnuckles was back in the USA mainstream with his positive message. The launch of his Motivation world tour put Knuckles message again in the forefront on an International level and Knuckles realizes post 9/11 was a New Reality for him. In 2003 Knuckles released an exclusive mix album for Armani AX which also renewed his positive Message, and introduced the forthcoming studio album.He started digging through the vaults and writing, and came up with his first studio album to release in 7 years.\n\nA New Reality released April 2004 in the USA, UK, Italy, Australia, and Japan simultaneously, and continues to receive media attention.

He has let his services for many past organizations, including Meals on Wheels, GMHC, Pediatric AIDS, and most recently Harvey Milk School.\n\nSOUL HEAVEN RECORDS\n\nSoul Heaven came about from a conversation International resident & Master At Work Louie Vega had with original owner Oli White discussing the idea of taking Soulful house music to large-scale audiences & events around the world. Ministry of Sound seemed like the obvious choice as a world-class venue to launch this concept so Oli contacted Gareth Cooke and Simon Patterson who were running Rulin at MOS on Saturdays. It was decided that Bobby and Steve would be London Residents alongside Jeremy Newall, Phil Asher and Chrissy T & the first date was fixed. The name came about after Simon & Oli heard the Pastaboys mix Soul Heaven in the box at Ministry & a perfect name was chosen for a perfect night!\n\n\nBobby & Steve parted company along with Jeremy & Chrissy in 2003 but by this time the team was already established with Phil Asher, Andy Ward, Aaron Ross & Neil Pierce, soon to be joined by present owner Fleur Woolford in 2004 alongside an international roster which firmly placed Soul Heaven at the forefront of soulful house events around the world. Soul Heaven parties (House Music touched by Soul) always create a great buzz of excitement whether it\u2019s a sell out season in Ibiza with Louie Vega, a classy pool party in Miami for WMC or capacity road block event for Masters At Work at MOS.\n\nSoul Heaven has had a long standing residence at Ministry of Sound in London & has hosted parties in America, Australia, South Africa, China, Thailand, Korea, Indonesia & closer to home in France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Holland, Portugal & Switzerland. Soul Heaven has played host to some of the biggest names in House Music from International residents; LITTLE LOUIE VEGA and partner KENNY DOPE (plus of course MAW) to, TONY HUMPHRIES, FRANKIE KNUCKLES,JOCELYN BROWN, LIL LOUIS, BARBARA TUCKER, ANANE, JAZZY JEFF, DJ SPEN, OSUNLADE, JOE CLAUSSELL, RON CARROLL, KERRI CHANDLER, DENNIS FERRER, BLAZE, TERRY HUNTER, KARIZMA, MR.

But ask Frankie Knuckles about his tenure in Chicago at the ground-breaking nightclub The Warehouse in the 1980s or his friendship with legendary Paradise Garage DJ Larry Levan and Knuckles will likely reply by flashing a polite smile and changing the subject. Complimenting Knuckles for his 1997 Grammy Award for Remixer of the Year or his work with mainstream pop and R&B superstars such as the Diana Ross, The Pet Shop Boys and what will likely only get you a blush and a polite \u201cThank you.\u201d Don\u2019t take it personal, though; Frankie Knuckles isn\u2019t one to dwell on the past. Frankie Knuckles is more than a DJ; he\u2019s more than The Godfather of House; even terming him an icon of the underground doesn\u2019t do justice to his landmark accomplishments and career longevity. Simply put: Frankie Knuckles is timeless. So forget what you think you know about Frankie Knuckles; do yourself the favor of spending a night on his dance floor today. \u201cLeave the past at the door,\u201d Knuckles smiles, \u201cand I promise you won\u2019t be disappointed.\u201d\n\nThe Date resident, Stuart Patterson will be in full support.\n\nAnd another US guest in the form of NYC\u2019s DANNY WANG will be headlining the Disco room.

In the \u201990s, Wang relocated to New York City where he teamed up with Morgan Geist and created a 70\u2019s boogie inspired album. He has continued to stay true to his disco roots these days so we can expect an interesting/inspiring take on the broad church of Disco! \n\nThe Date resident Tim Keenoy + regulars Dave Jarvis (Faith) & Si Kurrage (SDM) will be in full support.\n\nThe usual stunning visuals will be in full effect in the downstairs studio/courtyard space.\n\n2 different sounds/vibes in 2 different environments adds up to an un-missable party & the 7th in the series.

During this exclusive ADE party at BAUT, Frankie Knuckles and Eric Kupper launch their new concept \u201cDirector\u2019s Cut - Live\u201d.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1982, Warehouse\u2019s resident DJ Frankie Knuckles played fresh edits of disco tunes. Those edits drove the crowd wild. A fabulous mixed crowd; racially, ethnically, sexually. Records \"heard at The Warehouse\" were soon shortened to \"house\". And thus, a legend was born. Among other outstanding accomplishments, Frankie Knuckles became the first recipient of a Grammy for Remixer of The Year in 1998 (he lent his talents to artists such as Mary J. Blige, Michael Jackson, Diana Ross,Luther Vandross, Michael Bolton and Toni Braxton). In short: Frankie Knuckles turned out to be one of the most important figures in the history of music.\n\nDIRECTOR\u2019S CUT - LIVE\nSo what\u2019s new? Frankie is making a huge comeback! His sound is bubbling under many major DJ sets this year - almost like the substantive response to EDM. Fuller and deeper. Having worked closely together with master producer Eric Kupper to create some of the most memorable house classics in the Def Mix catalogue, it was a natural progression for them to officially pair up as a production duo two years ago, under the alias \u201cDirector\u2019s Cut\u201d. Fulfilling their aim to fill a noticeable void in sophisticated, warm, vocal house music, Director\u2019s Cut has made significant progress. The duo is now ready to premier their new live performance exclusive at the Amsterdam Dance Event, including an extended 6 hour DJ performance and live keys from Eric Kupper. Future \u201cDirector\u2019s Cut - Live\u201d editions around the world will include vocalists too. Expect an old school house party with a twist, taking place on Friday the 18th as the pinnacle of BAUT\u2019s ADE program.\n\nHector Romero takes over the dancefloor around midnight. The Bronx native spinned all downtown Manhattan clubs and spends a great deal of time travelling and DJ\u2019ing around the world. Hector is also a music business executive, running David Morales\u2019 Def Mix label DMI and looking after the day-to-day operations of SAW.RECORDINGS. Curious about his sound? Listen to one of his monthly Def Mix Radio Podcast, featured on iTunes and DefMix.com. As the temperature rises, so does DJ Meme. Brazil\u2019s top House DJ and critically acclaimed remixer/producer gained recognition early in his career creating mega mixes for the likes of The Bee Gees, New Order & the Pet Shop Boys among others. Fast forward to today and DJ Meme\u2019s magical heartfelt music is a regular on soulful dancefloors worldwide, with his talent for producing beautiful emotional house laced with his signature strings and disco flavours. And it is not over yet. A soulful Dutch surprise can be expected to close and bring the perfect ending to this unforgettable night at BAUT.\u201d\nFrankie Knuckles states: \u201cMusic is much like fashion. The styles and trends go around and comeback around. I remember having a conversation a few years back about bringingthe BPM back down to a more sensible tempo. Every track that was coming outthen was hovering around 126 to 128/30. With releases 'I'll Take You There' (which featured long time friend and vocalist Jamie Principle) and 'Blind' by Hercules & The Love Affair we found the marketplace primed for a moderated ance tempo, ultimately giving the dancer greater longevity on the dancefloor.\u201d\nPietro Cuevas (Promoter Hip & Hyper) adds: \u201cWe felt ADE needed this view point, so we pushed hard for it. This is the perfect antidote to ADE\u2019s techno and EDM overdose, with BAUT as the stand in for The Warehouse.\u201d\n\nBOVENBAUT\nOn the second floor (called \u2018BovenBAUT\u2019), Nicc Johnson is opening with another winningformula: his strong track selection and groove in his sets from funky room tomain room hitting all sides and sub genres of House music. Born in Amsterdam; Nicc was thrust into music from an early agewhen he moved with his family to Ibiza. Currently he\u2019s in his 6th season as a resident Pacha Ibiza, rocking the Pacha Funky Room. Hector Romero takes over the upper dance floor around 1 o\u2019clock. The Bronx native spinned all downtown Manhattan clubs and spends a great deal of time travelling and DJ\u2019ing around the world. Hector is a music business executive also, running David Morales\u2019 Def Mix label DMI and looking after the day-to-day operations of SAW.RECORDINGS. As the temperature rises at BAUT, so does DJ Meme.

The Hip&Hyper crew is thrilled to present Frankie Knuckles, who they\u2019ve met on Ibiza. But what is Hip&Hyper?

What really needs to be said about Frankie Knuckles to hype you up? What really needs to be said about Frankie Knuckles to convince you that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity? He's the godfather of House music. He's the reason we all listen to what we do, love what we do. He's the reason we jack. He's the reason we set ourselves free. He's a legend. We're \u00fcber excited to also be teaming up with our compadres from Resident Advisor for this one as well who are going to be doing some awesome features on their site leading up to the party so keep your mouse firmly refreshing on their homepage. To top it all off, it just wouldn't be right to bring such a legend anywhere else besides Kingdom. It's become our home away from home. It's the booth that we all love to play in, and the sound system we all love to hear. The bricks are laid, the house is built, all we need now is you! See you soon!",

Last year saw the likes of MK, Todd Edwards, Huxley and Paul Woolford grace a unique City Street from daytime 'til sunset.\n\nOn Saturday 21st September FOUND welcomes Detroit techno originator, Kevin Saunderson - who has been influential in his shaping of techno and house music as we know it - to inform and educate the masses on how the music has travelled since its inception 2 decades ago. As one half of Inner City (the duo behind the seminal track 'Good Life') Kevin Saunderson has played a pivotal part in shaping the disco, funk and soul sounds of the 70s into the inspired sounds we hear & love today. A rare breed and true living legend.\n\nJoining Saunderson is the 'Godfather of House Music', Frankie Knuckles, who has played an unprecedented role in revolutionising house music's journey since day dot. Expect the NYC-born, Detroit-based producer to flavour your Saturday afternoon with 3 hours of informed and considered underground sounds to enlighten your life and illustrate just how and why house music is the uplifting force it's grown into.\n\nSupport comes from the fresh talents of Voyeur, who\u2019s 2012 debut EP \u2018Blame It On The Youth\u2019 was snapped up by Kerri Chandler\u2019s Madtech imprint. Their opening Main Stage set at FOUND festival in June was praised by party-goers, with the pair looking set for big things to come. Opening proceedings will be FOUND\u2019s favoured identical duo, party starters The Menendez Brothers.\n\nAs with last year there'll also be a warehouse afterparty nearby for when the sun goes down. Details announced soon.\n\nWith 3 hour sets from the most prestigious house & techno originators, well-stocked bars, delicious food and the most unique of locations, FOUND events sell-out in advance - make sure you're part of it.\n\nRA Tickets\nhttp://bit.ly/streetparty2013\n\n\u00a315 / \u00a317.50 / \u00a322.50 / \u00a327.50 On Sale Now / \u00a332.50\n\nhttp://www.foundseries.co.uk/",
