Born William Grigahcine, Snake\u2019s production work on Lady Gaga\u2019s 2011 effort Born This Way earned him a Grammy nod when it was nominated for Album of the Year in 2012. Also in 2012, he signed with Diplo\u2019s imprint Mad Decent and released the single \u201cBird Machine\u201d on the label in 2013. The singles \u201cSlow Down\u201d and \u201cTogether\u201d also arrived in 2013, along with more work for Gaga on her ARTPOP album. His big break as a solo artist came late in the year when \u201cTurn Down for What\u201d featuring Lil Jon arrived and became the most popular crossover trap hit since Baauer\u2019s \u201cHarlem Shake.\u201d\n\nHailing from Paris, Tchami, is no stranger to the dance music industry. Coming on to the scene with his remix of Janet Jackson\u2019s \u201cGo Deep\u201d. The track became an instant over night hit! With much critical acclaim, he soon followed up with his first original production \u201cPromesses\u201d with Kaleem Taylor via Fool\u2019s Gold Records and Ministry of Sound. It was not too long after \u201cPromesses\u201d that Tchami released \u201cShot Caller\u201d under the same EP for Fool\u2019s Gold Clubhouse. From then on, Tchami subsequently released his remixes of AlunaGeorge\u2019s \u201cYou Know You Like It\u201d, JackU\u2019s \u201cTake U There\u201d, and many more. Having gained the support from some of today\u2019s top DJs such as A-Trak, Diplo, Dillon Francis and Skrillex, to name a few.\n\nThere is a new generation of French DJs/Producers with international fame, Mercer is one of them. Hardwell first sensed a massive record in \u201cWelcome to the Jungle\u201d and signed it on his label. Track produced with ALVARO featuring Lil Jon, that reached a Top 3 on Beatport and had 3 million views on YouTube. Renowned Spinnin Records spotted the talent and released two tracks: \u201cSupreme\u201d and \u201cTurn It Up\u201d.\n\nWho is Malaa?",
